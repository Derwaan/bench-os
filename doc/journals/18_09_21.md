## Brainstorming

After a brainstorming, we come to the idea to have a set of tasks and a set of criterion for each task.

For each criteria, we will implement different tasks. For example, for the switching context, we could create tasks with different CPU loads.

After a while, tasks could be used for multiple criterion.

### Criterion

- Switching context
- Interrupt latency
- DMA
- Memory alloc/dealloc
- Entropy
- Power consumption
- ...

### Tasks

- Idle
- Stress test
- Cryptographic
- Sensors reading
- Monitoring
- Compression
- Scheduling
- ...


## Next-steps

We decided to focus on two criterion: **switching context** and **interrupt latency**.
