Both raspberry 26 and 31 have now unique hostname (resp. raspberry26 and raspberry31).
The installation of the Realtek Wifi works on the raspberry 26. On the raspberry 31, installing the realtek driver was a bad idea as it corrupt every interface. A complete reset is necessery on the raspberry 31.

## Next-steps

- Try the I2C Protocol between the RE-Mote and one of the Raspberry
- Reflash the raspberry 31
- Configure the wifi on raspberry 31
