# September 13th 2018 -- RIOT Summit 2018

## From R&D to production -- _Jaime Jamenez_

- What we learn ?
  - There a lot of standards for three layers: connectivity, application and security
  - The IOT world is divided among 4 major players: System integrators, cloud providers, telecom infrastructure and operators. Each one with specific goals. Between those 4 major players there is room for start-up and innovative companies.
  - The open source in the R&D field is quite difficult. Patents for software are illegal in Europe.
  - Start-up doesn't need to reinvent the wheel and use existing standards.
- What will be useful for our thesis ?
  - Presented standards.

## NimBLE - Portable bluetooth stack from Apache Mynewt -- _Szymon Janc_

- What we learn ?
  - Apache Mynewt is an interesting RTOS.
  - BLE stands for Bluetooth Low Energy and is build from scratch.
  - Bluetooth has goes trough a lot of improvements.
- What will be useful for our thesis ?
  - Apache Mynewt is modern and complete.
  - NimBLE can be interesting to benchmark.

## Google Protocol Buffers for embedded IoT -- _Morgan Kira_

- What we learn ?
  - JSON/XML format is heavy for the IoT (parsing). Binary format are preferred like CBOR.
  - GPB can be used to create our own data structure.
  - Pro and con of this protocol.
  - Nano-PB is the implementation for the IoT.
- What will be useful for our thesis ?
  - RTOS that integrates JSON or XML can be improved with other structured data representation.

## Resources Discovery in CoAP -- _Christian Ams√ºss_

- What we learn ?
  - Resource discovery is like the search engine for the IoT.
  - Proxy can be used to re-transmit packets.
  - The security layer for CoAP is OSCORE (object security). It will hide CoAP requests inside a POST request with an encrypted payload.
- What will be useful for our thesis ?
  - The CoAP is too high-level for our thesis.

## ~~Automating my house using KNX -- _Bas Stottelaar_~~

## Build a robot with RIOT -- _Gilles Doffe_

- What we learn ?
  - The scheduler of RIOT is tickless. Tasks need to be cooperative or use interrupt call.
  - The speaker shows us a panel of issues that a real application can have with a real-time OS (constraint memory, scheduling, clock period, tasks taking too much time).
- What will be useful for our thesis ?
  - We need to take into account the type of scheduler used by the RTOS. A more theoretical approach will be needed.

## Usable security for RIOT and IoT -- _Olaf Bergmann_

- What we learn ?
  - DCAF (delegated CoAP Authorization Framework). In RTOS like RIOT, all technology are already there to implement an authorization framework. It will use CoAP and DTLS in order to identify another node.
- ~~What will be used for our thesis ?~~

## New crypto fundamentals in RIOT -- _Pieter Kietzmann_

- What we learn ?
  - Entropy in IoT is not easy.
  - With Physical Unclonable Functions, one can generate seed or key.
- What will be useful for our thesis ?
  - Entropy can be one of our criterion.
  - We could check how an RTOS generate random numbers.

## TLSv1.3 and RIOT -- _Daniele Lacamera_

- What we learn ?
  - We learn the new features of TLSv1.3 and WolfSSL that implement it in IoT.
- ~~What will be useful for our thesis ?~~

## ~~Using RIOT as demo platform for Uptane OTA updates -- _Anton Gerasimov_~~

## Implementing post-quantum cryptography on the Cortex M4 -- _Joost Rijneveld_

- What we learn ?
  - Quantum computing will break asymmetric cryptography.
  - Symmetric cryptography could be keep safe by using bigger keys.
- ~~What will be useful for our thesis ?~~

## Securing the IoT using SPIN -- _Elmer Lastdrager_

- What we learn ?
  - SPIN stands for Security and Privacy for In-home Network.
  - The protocol help to secure the internet from infected house with malicious IoT devices.
  - Lot of methods can be used to secure the network.
    - Define profile for each devices
    - Detect anomaly
    - Specify policy for each devices
- ~~What will be useful for our thesis ?~~

## Additional information

- STM32F4 are an highly compatible board.
  - STM32 series seems interesting.
  - 32 bits - Cortex M4
- We had a talk with "Savoir-faire Linux" and the approach "logical analyser" seems a good approach.
