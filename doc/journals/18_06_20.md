## Which **RTOS**

- (FreeRTOS)
  - Big learning curve
- Contiki
- RIOT
- TinyOS
  - Big learning curve

## Protocol to benchmark the OS

- Using the Serial BUS to output timestamp
  - Slow, not real value
- Using the mote to store timestamp
  - Slow, not real value
- **Using a logic analyzer**
  - Using it to see pin output
  - Programmable analyzer !?
- Using a Raspberrry Pi that act as a logic analyser

## Criterion of the OS

- Scheduling
- RAM ? â€”> Question to the promoter
- Switching Context
- Threading
- Real-Time
- Mutex
- Interrupt
- ... ?

## Criterion of the Network Stack

- Size of packets
- Size of window
- Network build
- Bandwidth
- Reliability
- Collision

## Planning

- First focus on the OS (threading, real-time, tasks, ...)
- Then focus on the Network Stack
- Iterative process
  - By OS
  - By devices

- [ ]  Define the protocol and the objectives
- [ ]  Read the articles

## Objectives

- Create a list of task for every criterion

## Devices

- **Zolertia Z1**
- Zolertia RE-MOTE
- Raspberry Pi

## Example of protocol

### Basic task

```c
void task_basic() {
  while(1) {
  GPIO_OUTPUT(PIN_1); // Output voltage to pin 1
  delay(100);
  }
}
```

Using the `task_basic`, we can check the delay.

### Switching context

Creating two tasks:

```c
void task_a() {
  while(1) {
    GPIO_OUTPUT(PIN_1); // Output voltage to pin 1
    delay(100);
  }
}

void task_b() {
  while(1) {
    GPIO_OUTPUT(PIN_2); // Output voltage to pin 2
  }
}
```

The `task_a` will have an higher priority than the `task_b`. Connecting the pin 1 and pin 2 to a logical analyzer, we can measure the time elapsed when the OS switches from `task_a` to `task_b`.
