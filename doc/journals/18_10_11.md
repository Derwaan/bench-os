During the afternoon, we try to figure out a framework that could be use by anyone.
A lot of benchmarking routines already exists (MiBench, ExpressLogic, ...).
But those framework doesn't allow the user to test their own applications.

Our goal is to create a benchmarking framework that anyone can use to measure their own applications performances with a RTOS.

For example, an user want to know on which RTOS its application will have the best performance.

We can represent the situation with those stacks:

```
+-------------------+
|    Application    |
+-------------------+
|       RTOS        |
+-------------------+
|     Hardware      |
+-------------------+
```

We have to idea to create this benchmarking framework.

## Develop an extension to the RTOS

We could develop our benchmarking features next to the RTOS.
Doing so, an user could call functions from the application level in order to benchmark part of the application.

```
+---------------------+
|     Application     |
+---------------------+
| RTOS | Benchmarking |
+---------------------+
|      Hardware       |
+---------------------+
```

## External benchmarking tool

We could externalize the benchmarking framework.
The user would have to plug its board to a benchmarking board in order to measure the performance of its application.

```
+-------------------+          +-------------------+
|    Application    |          |    Application    |
+-------------------+          +-------------------+
|       RTOS        |          |       RTOS        |
+-------------------+          +-------------------+
|     Hardware      |          |     Hardware      |
+-------------------+----------+-------------------+
|                       Link                       |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

The next steps for us to is make a **proof of concept**.
