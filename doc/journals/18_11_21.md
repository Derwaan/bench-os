## Summary
We spent the last 2 weeks working on finding solutions for benchmarking context switchings in RIOT.
We found multiple solutions:

##### Modifying each cpu family 
This solution isnt doable.
Each family is uses different assembly languages and it will be too time consuming.

##### Timers at application level
This is the current most promising solution.
For now we're using RIOT's xtimer which is not the ideal solution since it is not accurate enough.
We need to find a way to use an external timer with the help of a logic analyser or not.

##### Timer at kernel level
In theory it is possible to add a timer in the kernel but we will be ending with the question: does the context switch takes more time because we are measuring it?

## Next steps
- Explore application level solutions with and without logic analyser
- Choose another OS and begin exploring it
- Work on poster.
