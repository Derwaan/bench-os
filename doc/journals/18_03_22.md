**Warning**: The I2C protocol cannot be used between two Raspberry Pi. One need to act as the master while the other one is the slave. But Raspberry Pi cannot be configured into the slave. The solution is to use Ethernet to communication between the Raspberry Pis.

We have installed on both Raspberry Pi (26 and 31) **Raspbian-Lite**. They are configured to use SPI, I2C and SSH.
The question is: _How to configure them with a static IP in order to work trough SSH ?_

**Contiki** with the Hello-World example was flashed to the RE-Mote. It was successfull.

## Next-steps

- Try the I2C Protocol between the RE-Mote and one of the Raspberry
- Configure the Wi-Fi once the dongle is received
