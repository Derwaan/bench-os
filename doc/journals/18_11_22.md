# Why not using xtimer module to measure context-switching time?

The xtimer module will give a 1 microsecond precison. A context-switch can take around 10 microseconds to finish.
With this in mind, we could do an average of multiple context-switches to get a better precision.
Using a **timer peripheral** seems also a good solution.

# Using message for sending the timer -> Inter-process communication
I use a message to send the timer value to the other thread. No problem with Z1
