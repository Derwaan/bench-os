Looks like the raspberry 31 is connected to the Wifi in the end...
Here are the hardware addresses collected for both of the raspberry pis:

| HwAddress | Raspberry 26      | Raspberry 31      |
|---------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| wlan0     | 50:3E:AA:34:31:E2 | 50:3E:AA:34:B3:9D |
| eth0      | B8:27:EB:C4:E5:C8 | B8:27:EB:5D:61:56 |

For the I2C, the following packet is required: `i2c-tools` and with it the following tool are available: `i2cdetect`, `i2cget` and `i2cset`. Also, it looks like both of the raspberry are already inside the database of allowed MAC to the DHCP.

Both raspberry pis are upgrade with `Vim` and `i2c-tools`.

## Next-steps

- Contact with the INGI to get fixed IP
- Test the I2C
