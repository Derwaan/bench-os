# Roadmap

This document presents a broad overview of our thesis.

## Context

Internet of Things (IoT) developers are working with highly-constrained devices. 
Real-time operating systems (RTOS) offer to developers libraries, modules, packages, drivers that they can use to implement their own applications.
Energy consumption, memory usage, context switching time, interrupt latency and many others are metrics that RTOSs must watch in order to be performant in the real world.
With this in mind, IoT communities are looking for tools that could perform those measurements easily for them.

## Objectives

Our objective is to create a benchmarking framework that one can freely use to measure various performance metrics of its application running on any RTOS.

## Learning outcomes

- Demonstrate the mastering of a body of knowledge and skills in computer science.
- Understand and contribute to the resolution of an original scientific question.
- Communicate with open source community and searchers.

## Proposed methods

TBD.

## Available technical and human resources

## Bibliographical research
